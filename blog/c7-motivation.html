      <h2><strong>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lense?</strong></h2>
      <p>If you're priveleged, life through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lense looks sustainable. To live like this is to focus less on the brief and ultimately unsatisfying pleasure we get from say partying on a friday night after work, and to instead transfer that energy to our sense of purpose and the meaning that we attribute to our work. </p>
      <h2><strong>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise:</strong></h2>
      <h2><strong>What are your core values?</strong></h2>
      <p>To be empathetic, open-minded and altruistic. Empathy is extremely important to me, without it the world would be a very difficult and lonely place.</p>
      <h2><strong>What do you stand for?</strong></h2>
      <p>Equality, intersectionality and sustainability</p>
      <h2><strong>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</strong></h2>
      <p>I found the meditation exercise quite freaky at first, it's not nice to revist your failings. I see how it is important though, to go back there and engage with a new perspective as opposed to just burying forever. Obviously returning to success was a lot easier, but again important to engage with these feelings physiologically, as they are simply experiences that come and go.</p>
      <h2><strong>Any other musings?</strong></h2>
      <p>I love this book. :)</p>
