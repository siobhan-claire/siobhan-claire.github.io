           <h2><strong>What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?</strong></h2>
           <p>Covering my angel staff when they were too exhausted/unstable to come into work! Seriously though I feel like when anyone working under me made a mistake or made my working life harder my initial reaction was usually one of frustration and annoyance but I always made sure to engage with kindness and humilty. I didn't want anyone to lose motivation or to infect them with negative feelings.</p>
           <h2><strong>Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it?</strong></h2>
           <p> Yeah it was really nice and made me feel good. Very positive.</p> 
           <h2><strong>Do the Tonglen meditation. How did you find it?</strong></h2>
           <p>Again, it was really nice. Initially, it was hard imagining someone I love suffering but it felt so good to breathe out rays of light and alleviate the pain.</p>
           <h2><strong>How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?</strong></h2>
           <p> I guess with phase 0 the certainty and autonomy hold true, but the other concepts havent been particularly relevent to this part of my experience. Reading through the SCARF model though, I can see how it will be useful during my time in bootcamp.</p> 
           <h2><strong>Have a difficult conversation. How did it go? (It's a valuable skill, but can take practice to develop!)</strong></h2>
           <p>I'm always having difficult conversations! It's so important to explore both perspectives and really listen to the person and try to understand where they're coming from. If they do the same for you then you both should be able to move on from the problem peacefully.</p>
