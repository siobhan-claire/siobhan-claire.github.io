  <h2><strong>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</strong></h2>
  <p> Eventhough I'm quite extroverted I also hate the sound of my own voice and prefer listening over talking. Initially I found it hard not to giggle and to focus on what I was saying but I eased into it and when it was over I felt pretty good. My friend is a total thespian who LOVES the sound of her own voice as well as meditation and mindfullness etc so she took to it quite well.</p>
  <h2><strong>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</strong></h2>
  <p>I'm going to give walking meditation a go, I might try it in the park on my way home from work - if the weather permits.</p>
