 <h2><strong>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</strong></h2>

 <p>Tan uses two quotes:<br>

 "Self-awareness is a neutral mode that maintains self-reflectiveness even in the midst of turbulent emotions."
 -Daniel Goleman<br>

 "Mindfulness means paying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgmentally."
 -Jon Kabat-Zinn<br>

 Basically both concepts exist for the same purpose - being mindful and self aware is to pay attention to yourself and your emotions so as not to let them become or consume you.</p>  

 <h2><strong>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling).
 What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</strong></h2>

 <p>Because I already keep a journal I decided to try the body scan technique. Initially I found it difficult to concentrate because the ambience at my place/krd isn't exactly relaxed. However I took my time to really focus and found it to be very soothing. I'm currently quite emotionally exhausted and it was amazing to be able to let everything go for a moment and actually feel it leave my body.</p> 

 <h2><strong>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</strong></h2>

 <p>Honeslty I found that part of the chapter so important and definitely something I needed to read. I think it's so easy to forget that our emotions aren't our core selves-that they come and go and we experience them only momentarily. Though I also think it's important to remember that people suffer from chronic depression and anxiety as well as many other forms of mental illness it can take a lot more than being mindful and self aware for them to overcome and deal with it.</p>
