     <h2><strong>What a responsive site is, and why responsiveness is important.</strong></h2>
     <p>A responsive website is one that a user can view and will look good on any device. Through the implementation of media queries in css, a website can be resized -made bigger or smaller, even the content can be hidden and moved- so it looks good on any screen. It's important because it provides the user with optimal viewing, interaction, ease of reading and navigation with basically no effort on their part.</p>

     <h2><strong>What mobile first design is, and why it's important.</strong></h2>
     <p>Designing a website with basically the smallest screen in mind first and then working your way up from there. From a developers perspective this is because mobile design is the hardest and once completed designing for other, larger devices will be easier. Also it means that because it is the smallest design, it will have only the esssential features so the developer has already designed the core of the 'user experience'. It is important because if a site is good on a mobile device it will translate well to all devices and designing within such small paramters means ruthless prioritisation of content - which is what the user of a site is there for, content.</p> 

    <h2><strong>What frameworks are, and their pros and cons.</strong></h2>
    <p>Frameworks are basically prescribed CSS files that you integrate and use to style your website. The good thing about this is that it saves a lot of time and effort and lends itself well to the creation of a responsive website.The downside when implementing a framework is that if you want to style your content in a way that is different to the framework you have to overwrite the code yourself.</p>

    <h2><strong>What a wireframe is and why we use it.</strong></h2>
    <p>At its most basic level, a wireframe can be compared to an architectural blueprint. When designing a website a developer can't write blocks of code without knowing where it's going to go - much like an architect when it comes to building a house. Developers use it because it allows them to plan the layout and interaction of an interface without being distracted by style - colours, typeface choices etc.</p>
