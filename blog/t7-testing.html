   <h2><strong>What is scope, and how does it works in JavaScript.</strong></h2>
   <p>In JavaScript scope refers to the the current context of you code. It has two scopes: global and local. Before you write a line of code you are in the global scope and if a variable is declared then and there it is defined globally:</p>
   <pre><code>   //global scope
   var name = "Siobhan";</code></pre>

   <p>A local scope on the other hand, refers to any scope defined past the global scope. A variable that is declared inside a function definition is local and it cannot be accessed by any code outside the function. Any function defined within another function also has a local scope which is linked to the outer function. If a function is defined and variables are created inside it, those variables become locally scoped:</p>
   <pre><code>  // Scope A: Global scope out here
   var myFunction = function () {
  // Scope B: (variables) Local scope in here
  };</code></pre>

  <p>As mentioned earlier, any locally scoped items are not visible in the global scope. If functions or variables are defined within a new scope, they cannot be accesssed from outside of their current scope:</p>
  <pre><code>var myFunction = function () {
  var name = "Siobhan";
  console.log(name); // Siobhan
  };
  // Uncaught ReferenceError: name is not defined
  console.log(name);</code></pre>

  <p>Also it is important to note that a local variable can have the same name as a global variable, but it is entirely separate; changing the value of one variable has no effect on the other. Only the local version has meaning inside the function in which it is declared.
