  <h2><strong>Problem Solving Part 1</strong></h2>
  <p>I am constantly getting stuck on problems and as soon as it happens my first reaction is to take a deep breath and go through my usual routine of problem solving. A recent example would be during the freecodecamp part of sprint-4. I found myself stuck on a problem so my first step was to google, which unfortuantely was of no help so I reached out to my cohort and engaged in a bit of psuedocode with them until I realised I had somehow gone from task 3 all the way to task 49 and this is why it wasn't making any sense to me - because I had skipped 46 steps without realising! I feel like this is so often the case and it is a huge relief to realise that no you are not complete idiot for not understanding the code, you're just an idiot who forgot a curly bracket or that you somehow managed to skip 46 questions. I think it's important to go over everything very slowly when you're blocked- not to freak out and google the solution because you don't really learn anything that way.</p>
  

  <h2><strong>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</strong></h2>

   <p><strong>Pseudocode:</strong></p><p>Because I'm still struggling a lot with syntax, I use this technique all the time.</p>
   <p><strong>Trying something:</strong></p><p>I'm never not trying something? I don't get this one!</p>
   <p><strong>Rubber ducky method:</strong></p><p>I barely use this one because I don't really have anyone around me who would understand what I'm talking about, I guess i occasionally read my problem aloud to myself though.</p>
   <p><strong>Reading error messages:</strong></p><p>Love it! especially when you're told which line the problem is on</p>
   <p><strong>Console.logging:</strong></p><p>Perfect for testing your code, use it all the time.</p>
   <p><strong>Googling:</strong></p><p>Where would any of us be without Google? I love you Google.</p>
   <p><strong>Asking your peers for help:</strong></p><p>Sometimes I don't want to bother them but it's definitely the best way to understand where you went wrong and to learn from it.</p>
   <p><strong>Asking coaches for help:</strong></p><p>Always a last resort.</p>
   <p><strong>Improving your process with reflection:</strong></p><P>I think this is one of the most important techniques, we can't really learn from our mistakes if we don't reflect on our work and pinpoint where we went wrong/what our strengths and weakness are.</P>

  <h2><strong>Using the JS Array docs as a starting point, describe what these functions do in your own words:</strong></h2>

   <p><strong>.map()</strong></p><p>The map() method means we can avoid using a loop and save time via adding a function into another function.</p>
   <p><strong>.filter()</strong></p><p>This method is used to filter results according to what you want from an array. For example if you had an array of various ages but you wanted only those over 18 your could use the filter method to return that result and create a new array of 18yo and older. </p>
   <p><strong>.reduce()</strong></p><p>I don't think I've come across this yet do not my own words but according to developer.mozzilla: The reduce() method applies a function against an accumulator and each value of the array (from left-to-right) to reduce it to a single value.</p>
