           <h2><strong>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</strong></h2>
           <p>I feel like I always try my best to approach people with kindness- and to avoid making any assumptions about their character- especially people I connect with and feel like I want to get to know more. I think in doing that trust is established right away and it's easier to be open with one another.</p>
           <h2><strong>Try empathic listening - how did it go?</strong></h2>
           <p>yeah good! depending on the seriousness of the conversation/how close I am to the person this is how I usually listen to people. This time was slightly awkward as it was kind of artificial and the topics discussed were quite trivial but I understand how important empathic listening is.</p> 
           <h2><strong>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</strong></h2>
           <p>I loved it. Honestly this is how I try to live my life! People are so quick to react without taking a few measley seconds to process the situation and breathe. People are also very quick to judge and make assumptions about a person without considering the fact that they're a person- with wants and needs and feelings exactly the same as everyone else.</p>
           <h2><strong>Complete the political awareness exercise here in writing.</strong></h2>
           <p>I did this one aloud to myself as I didn't feel comfortable sharing my conflict. I understand the point of this exercise though.</p> 
           <h2><strong>Any other musings?</strong></h2>
           <p>Empathy forever!</p>
