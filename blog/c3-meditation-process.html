      <h2><strong>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</strong></h2>
      <p>It encouarged me to focus on the commands I was performing and the tags/code I was implementing and how it all works as opposed to the look of my website. It's useful in that it helped me (sort of) understand all the little 'magic spells' I was performing and most importantly that my page, basic html and css included, was functioning correctly and responsively.</p>

      <h2><strong>Read or watch chapter 2 of Search Inside Yourself, and reflect:</strong></h2>
      <p>What did you think about mediation before reading chapter 2?
      That it has a lot to do with being grounded and aware of your body through breathing. That breathing exercises will help with anxiety and calmness and that it is important to take some time out each day to just be.</p>

      <h2><strong>What new things have you learnt about mediation?</strong></h2>
      <p>That you can pay attention to attention itself and that meditation can have tangible, physical affects on skin conditions.</p> 

      <h2><strong>Did any of the suggested mediation techniques stand out to you?</strong></h2>
      <p>I enjoyed the passage about whether or not your eyes should be opened or closed during meditation and that the solution to this problem - 'temporal or spatial compromise' can be easily achieved. Temporal is when you start with your eyes closed and occassionally open them when you feel yourself starting to fall asleep and spatial is the oppostie, start with your eyes open and as soon as you become distracted by visual surrounding you close your eyes.<p> 

      <h2><strong>Any other musings?</strong></h2>
      <p> I really loved the bit about 'the grandmother mind' - the importance of seeing and loving yourself as your grandmother does. </p>
