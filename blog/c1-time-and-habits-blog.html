    <h3>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h3>
    <p>I already do a little bit of meditation but I am keen to try out the pomodoro technique! I desparately need to disconnect a little bit from social media- no more endless, mindless scrolling!</p>
    <h3>What did you find interesting?</h3>
    <p>I found the power of meditation article very interesting, particularly the 'what happens in your brain when you meditate' part. Eventhough I already do a little bit of meditation, it's never really ocurred to me to really think about what is going on and the very positive effects it has. I look forward to practicing yoga during boot camp!</p>
    <h3>What worked for you?</h3>
    <p>Well because it is so early I havent been able to try out too much, but I know for a fact meditation works. I am currently using the Pomodoro technique while I fill out this time and habits blog and it seems like a pretty positive habit to get into.</p>
    <h3>Which will you experiment further with?</h3>
    <p>As well as meditation, I think I will use the Pomodoro technique as it seems pretty straightforward and easy to understand. Also I need something that will help with my time management as that is something that has been stressing me out quite a bit.</p>
