    <h3>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h3>
    <p>From my very limited experience so far, I believe it is about feeling comfortable asking for support and working with your cohort to help each other out. Of course it is important to engage with the resources and material provided but it seems like the most important resources we have are each other.</p>

    <h3>What are your impressions?</h3>
    <p>Again it is the overwhelming amount of support from my peers that has really impressed me. It seems like EDA takes this very seriously as we are all coming into this with not only different levels of understanding but entirely different backgrounds and skill sets! So yeah the emphasis on communication and support really helps foster a sense of empathy and makes everything a little less daunting.</p>

    <h3>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h3>
    <p>With ease! I'm definitely a bit of an extrovert/people person so I feel very at home working so closely with other people. In the past i've been quite stubborn/too proud when it comes to asking for help but I feel very comfortable and at ease amongst my nikau peers.</p>

    <h3>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h3>
    <p>Well because I enrolled quite last minute I didn't really have enough time to mentally prepare or think about my expectations. But I can say that outside of weekly checkins the involvment from the tutors is a lot less than I expected! It really is up to us to figure things out for ourselves-with the help of one another course.</p>

    <h3>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h3>
    <p>I am deeply excited to participate in this learning environment. I definitely work better alongside others than I do alone - I become bored and easily distracted otherwise. The only thing I'm nervous about is falling behind and balancing my study with work. Thankfully I have the support of my cohort just in case.</p>
