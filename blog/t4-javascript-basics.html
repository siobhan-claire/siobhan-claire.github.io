     <h2><strong>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</strong></h2>
     <p>The main point of comparison is that JavaScript is a more advanced language for designing web pages. With HTML you are doing no more than creating basic content i.e paragraphs, headings, tables, static images; and the CSS is used to style that content in the way you would like it to be displayed on your webpage. JavaScript however is interactive and programs the behaviour of the web page.</p>

     <h2><strong>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.</strong></h2>
     <p>Control Flow is basically assessing a situation and taking action accordingly. For example, my alarm sounds in the morning; if it's 7.00am - dang! I have to get up and go to work, if it reads 9.00am - hooray! it's the weekend and I can sleep in. A loop is the process of repeating an action until you no longer can or you have achieved desired result. We can go back to the alarm clock and use the snooze funtion as an example; I know that if I'm not out of bed by 7:30am I am definitely going to be late for work - I am allowed to hit snooze three times before dragging myself out of bed.</p>


     <h2><strong>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and object literals.</strong></h2>
     <p>Each character in an array is assigned a number according to its position within the array and is sequential from 0 up. If I wanted to retrieve the letter 'r' in the word 'strong' I would call on array[2]. Object literals however are literal words we call on to access our data. For example if I want to retreive someones name from their passport I would use passport.name.</p>
     
     <h2><strong>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</strong></h2>
     <p>A function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. It's useful because you can use it over and over again with different arguments to produce different results.</p>
