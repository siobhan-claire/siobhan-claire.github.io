    <h1>Udacity Reflection Part 1</h1>

    <h2><strong>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</strong></h2>
    <p>I think the analogy used in the Udacity tutorial was perfect. They suggested to think of these things like you would a house; that is the HTML can be thought of as the structure and the CSS as the design or style. For example, the different rooms of the house would be the HTML and the CSS is basically what each room will contain and look like.

    It is helpful to think of the DOM as the plan or layout of the house. The DOM will tell you how many rooms you have, whether that room is a bedroom or a bathroom, what these rooms contain and how they are styled. Because the DOM functions similarly to a sketch, you have the ability to rearrange, add and delete things within the DOM before committing to a final blueprint, much like you would when renovating a house.</p><br>

    <h2><strong>What is meant by boxifying design?</strong></h2>
    <p>It means that every single element contained within a single web page is also contained within a box - either a rectangle or square. Even circles live inside boxes! You can think of 'boxifying design' as a grid that organises the boxes which contain various parts of a webpage such as its logo or text.</p><br>

    <h2><strong>What is the box model?</strong></h2>
    <p>In design, for the purpose of CSS each HTML is considered a box. The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. The box consists of margins, borders, padding and actual content. The content is where the text and images appear, the padding is transparent and clears an area around the content, the border goes around the padding and content and the margin, also transparent, clears an area outside the border.
