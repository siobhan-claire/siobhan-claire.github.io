    <h2><strong>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</strong></h2>
    <p>That high levels of Emotional Intelligence are just as important, if not more so, than ones ability to analyse and think conceptually, and that EI results in better overall performance, communication and workplace happiness.<br> 

    It was interesting and reassuring to read that most people possess the ability to tap into and cultivate their emotions - that emotional intelligence is trainable - not just something only certain people are capable of. I was particularly fond of the idea that we can train our attention and avoid getting swept up in our emotion. We can instead examine it from a thrid person perspective and see it objectively as opposed to identifying with it and getting caught up and reacting in a useless manner.<br> 

    Finally, it was interesting to read about the way the body reacts to stressful situations before the mind does. So when we are upset for whatever reason, we will feel it vividly in our body and should focus on that rather than trying to think too much about it.</p>

    <h2><strong>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</strong></h2>
    <p>It was nice to read about mindfulness in relation to breathing. I agree with Chan-Meng Tan- a simple two minute breathing exercise is incredibly important and can work wonders in terms of stress and anxiety. I have been practicing breathing exercises for a few years and I can say it is an incredibly powerful technique.</p>
