   <h2><strong>What are some of my triggers? What causes a disproportionately large emotional response?</strong></h2>
   <p>I think I have a bad habit of comparing myself to others and sometimes I find myself obsessing over the fact other members of my cohort are well ahead of me. All this does is trigger feelings of inadequecy and that I'm not smart enough or good enough. Worst of all it prevents me from reaching out to my cohort for help because I feel too ashamed! I know this is ridiculous and I know I'm capable - I just need to realise that we all advance at different speeds and that's ok!</p>

   <h2><strong>How did you find the Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond technique?</strong></h2>
   <p>The Siberian North Railroad concept (stop, breathe, notice, reflect and respond) is something I wish I knew about earlier on in my adult life! In hindsight, it seems like a very powerful tool to calm the body and mind in moments of tension and high stress. I will definitely be employing this in the future whenever I feel like I might be losing control.</p>
