    <h2><strong>What is grid based design?</strong></h2>
    <p>It is simply an approach to design whereby a grid made up of x by y pixels contains all the elements of a web page. Basically it's a series of intersecting vertical and horizontal lines used to structure content.</p><br>

    <h2><strong>What is all the hype about responsive pages?</strong></h2><p>Responsive web design basically feels that the design and development of a webpage should respond the same way no matter what device someone is using. This means that developers can build a page using the @media rule so the page will respond and behave the same across a variety of platforms and screens.</p>
    

    <h2><strong>What is semantic structure?</strong></h2>
    <p>Basically organising your html so it has meaning. For example you use the 'p' tag to indicate that the content contained within is defined as a paragraph.
